A Monument for Peace,"In December, 1864, the Civil War was nearly over. The armies of the Union had conquered most of the South, but the fighting was not finished. Hoping to reverse the war's course, the Confederate general John Bell Hood marched his army toward Nashville. The capital of Tennessee, Nashville, had been under Union control since 1862. Capturing it, Hood hoped, could save the Confederacy.

It was freezing cold when the battle started on December 15th. The Confederate troops were outnumbered. They fought in ragged uniforms, sometimes without shoes. Against the superior Union army, they had no hope. On December 16th, Hood was defeated. The war was over.

The Union won the Civil War four months later. Although the Southern states returned to the Union, the country remained divided. Fifty years later, most of the war's veterans were dead. Around the country, towns and cities had begun building monuments in their memory. In the North, monuments were built to honor the Union. In the South, monuments honored the Confederacy. Even though the states were united again, no one built a monument to both sides.

In 1914, Mrs. James E. Caldwell and her group, the Ladies Battlefield Association, began raising money to build a monument for those who died in the Battle of Nashville. They hired Italian sculptor Giuseppe Moretti to design a statue. They raised money by hosting balls and asking local businesses for donations. By 1927, they had enough, and the monument was completed.

Moretti's statue showed a young man standing between two horses. Behind it, a tall white obelisk was built, with an angel at the top. ""No guns, no swords, no trappings of war mar the peace-like beauty,"" Mrs. Caldwell said. It was not a war monument, but a peace monument.

The structure was special because it honored all those who died in the war—no matter which side they fought for. Built less than a decade after World War I, it was also dedicated to the American soldiers of that conflict.

In 1974, a tornado knocked the 40-foot-tall obelisk to the ground, where it shattered to pieces, along with the angel at its top. Moretti's sculpture was damaged, but it was repaired. The city did not have the money, however, to build a new column. A few years later, an interstate was built beside the monument, blocking it from view, and making it hard for anyone to get to it.

For two decades, the monument was alone—out of sight and nearly forgotten by the public. In 1992, the Tennessee Historical Commission chose a new location for the monument, inside a small park near the original battlefield. Again, fundraising was necessary—to move the statue and construct a new obelisk.

The original statue cost $30,000 in 1927. To move and restore it would cost much more—some estimate more than $500,000. But after seven years of work, the money was collected, and the statue was rededicated—with a brand new obelisk to go with it. Finally, Mrs. Caldwell's monument was whole again, and the message of peace could be seen once more.

The Brooklyn Bridge,"Have you ever seen a picture of the Brooklyn Bridge? This is a famous bridge in New York City. It connects Brooklyn and Manhattan. Those are two parts of the city. 

How does the Brooklyn Bridge stay up? Big stone towers and big steel ropes! Big ropes go between two towers. More steel ropes hang from those big ropes. The roadway hangs from these ropes. 

The Brooklyn Bridge also has a web of steel ropes on each side. These make the bridge extra strong. That’s good, because many people and cars go across it every day!"
Pluto: The Planet That Wasn't,"Poor Pluto!

It’s bad enough to be the runt of the group, but to be told after 75 years that you’re not even a member of the club - what an insult!

Pluto was first discovered in 1930. Until 2006, students were taught that it was the ninth and smallest planet in the solar system. Smaller than Earth’s moon, it is not even as wide as the United States.

Pluto is made up almost entirely of rock and ice. It is so far away that it took the NASA New Horizons spacecraft over 11 years to get there from Earth. Pluto’s full orbit around the sun lasts almost 250 Earth years!

But as small as it is, as cold as it is, as far from the sun as it is, for all those years it was considered the ninth planet of the solar system... until Eris came around.

Eris was discovered in 2005. It is about the same size as Pluto. And like Pluto, it is part of the Kuiper Belt, a ring of objects that circle the outer edge of the solar system.

After Eris was discovered, scientists had to make a decision. Either Eris was the 10th planet in the solar system or it was not a planet at all! And if Eris weren’t a planet, could Pluto be considered one?

Scientists made new rules for what is counted as a planet, and decided that neither Pluto nor Eris qualified.

A new category was created: dwarf planet. The official list of planets in the solar system went from nine to eight, and Pluto and Eris became members of the dwarf planet club. So long for Planet Pluto—but at least it no longer has to be the littlest guy in the club. In fact, Pluto is one of the bigger dwarf planets! Maybe Pluto doesn’t have it so bad after all."
When Television Became Colorful,"Today, nearly all television programs are broadcast in color. If you turn on a baseball game, you can see that the grass on the field is green, or that the pitcher has a blue cap on. But when your grandparents were children, most people watching TV at home could not have seen any of those colors. Television programs were broadcast in black and white only.

Television sets that could broadcast in color have been around for a long time. An engineer named John Logie Baird invented a color TV set in the 1930s. But the picture on Baird’s TV flickered, and was not clear. Companies would not sell a TV that was not good quality.

For many years, people worked to improve how color televisions worked. Over time, companies found ways to make the picture clearer. The improvements also meant that a user could turn a dial to add just the right amount of color to the picture.

By the late 1960s, many people were buying color televisions. Soon, most TV shows were being broadcast in color, and most people in the U.S. had color TV sets.

Today, it’s unusual to find any television show that is still broadcast in black and white. Now the world of television is full of color!"
An Unlikely Parasite: The Mistletoe,"During the holidays, many people hang mistletoes over doorways. People share kisses under this evergreen plant. It is a popular Christmas tradition. But don’t let the image of a romantic plant used during the happy times of the holidays fool you. In the forests where they’re from, mistletoes can do some real damage. Let’s take a look at how and why.

The mistletoe plant is evergreen. This means it has leaves that remain green throughout the year. It is also poisonous and has white berries and small, yellow flowers. The mistletoe lives on other plants, taking water and nutrients from these plants. For this reason, mistletoes are considered parasites. The white berries of the mistletoes contain seeds. Some birds and mammals like to feed on these berries. When they do, the seeds may attach to the animal eating the berries. The animal may carry the seeds to another part of the tree or shrub. They may also carry the seeds to another plant altogether. The seeds start to grow roots that dig through the bark of the tree or shrub. The roots grow into the tissues of the plant they’ve taken over. That’s how mistletoes take nutrients and water away from the host plants. Mistletoe can be hard to remove once it infects a plant. The best way to fight off a mistletoe infestation is to cut off the infected branch completely. If the mistletoe takes over more parts of the plant, it can start to weaken the plant and make it harder for it to grow.

As mistletoes grow in the trees, they become a thick mix of branches and stems. This big mass is sometimes called a “witch’s broom.” Some animals nest in these witches’ brooms. These animals include chickadees, house wrens, and most Cooper’s hawks."
Predicting the Future,"Garry Golden sits in a small cafe in Brooklyn, New York. In front of him, sheets of paper with diagrams litter the table. He rapidly sketches trains, cars and highways as he explains his ideas. Garry Golden has one passion: transportation. The science of how to move people from place to place fascinates him. He spends his days studying the relationships between cars, subways, and trains. But he’s most excited about imagining the way these relationships will change in the next 20 years.

Golden is a futurist. Futurists are scientists who analyze the way the world is today and use that information to make predictions about what the world will be like in the future. In this way, they are the opposite of historians, who try to better understand the present through studying the past. Futurists hope that by making scientific predictions about the future, we can make better decisions today.

Some futurists study the environment. Some study human society. Golden focuses on the study of transportation. He earned his graduate degree in Future Studies from the University of Houston. Living in Houston for those two years changed the way he viewed transportation in the United States.

Many public transportation advocates dislike Houston. They argue the city is too sprawling (it can take more than three hours to drive from one side of the city to the other during rush hour) and that there aren’t enough buses and subways. However, Houston was a source of inspiration for Golden.

“Houston is a really interesting place, and their transportation is a fascinating story—it’s worth watching. When you think about it, what is the U.S. like? It’s more like Houston. So you need to understand how Houston approaches things to understand the country as a whole. New York City is the exception,” said Golden in an interview with The New York Times.

Golden points out that people in New York City own fewer cars and walk much more than anywhere else in the United States. “It’s a unique environment,” says Golden. “Very different from the rest of the country.”

However, Golden believes American cities will become more similar to New York City in several ways over the next 20 years. He sees a trend toward fewer cars in the future. He explains, “Cities have a cost of car ownership that is a challenge. All these vehicles cost the city: in services, in having to repair roads and all of the other things.” Cars also take up a lot of space. Houston, for example, has 30 parking spaces for every resident. That’s 64.8 million parking spaces in only one city.

Golden points out that having so many parking spaces is inefficient. Much of the time the parking spaces sit empty. At high-use times—for example, Saturday afternoon when everyone is running errands—every parking space at a shopping center is full. But at 3 a.m. on a Monday, no one is at the shopping center. What is the solution? “I think cities are going to start to legislate cars in very new ways,” says Golden. He explains that cities will make new laws to limit the number of cars people can have within city limits. Instead, people will use taxis, subways and buses. New technology, like smartphones, can make these forms of public transportation even better.

Buses have the same problem of inefficiency as parking spaces, explains Golden. Sometimes they are full, and sometimes they are empty. But imagine if everyone had a smartphone and used them to signal when they wanted to ride the bus. Buses could change their route, depending on who wanted to ride.

How soon would these changes come? Golden admits that it will take several years. Cities can be slow to change. Also, new systems of transportation can be expensive. “But it’s coming,” he says. “The trend of the empowered city will be here soon.”

The other trend that excites Golden is electric cars. “We need to reduce the amount of fuel we consume,” says Golden. “Everyone agrees on this. The question is how to do it.” Golden especially believes in the future of electric cars that have sensors to understand the world around them. “If we have cars that can communicate with one another, they can adjust speeds to eliminate traffic jams,” he says. Rush hour in Houston would suddenly be much less painful.

One challenge related to the production of electric cars is that it is hard to cheaply produce batteries that are strong enough for these cars. This is partially because cars are so heavy. But Golden argues you could also make cars out of strong plastic composites. The cars would then be much lighter and much cheaper to make. “This could revolutionize the highways,” he says. When could electric smart cars become the norm? Golden argues as soon as 2030.

As a futurist, Golden shares his predictions with other scholars at conferences across the country. He also provides advice to companies that want to know what the future will be like so that they can make better strategies. Golden remains optimistic about the future. “There are so many exciting developments,” he says. “In thirty years we will live a very different world.”"
Benjamin Franklin: The Ultimate Solution Creator,"Benjamin Franklin is credited with an array of inventions and accomplishments. Among these are the repeal of Britain’s Stamp Act, bifocals, the lightning rod, the Franklin stove, the reform, and creation of the original U.S. postal system. All are notable for being solutions, in the 1700s, to everyday problems faced by Franklin’s peers or to bigger social and political issues (like the American colonies’ lack of representation during Britain’s rule).

When faced with some kind of roadblock or trouble, Franklin was particularly adept at finding a way around it. Beyond his keen intuition that facilitated his discoveries and solutions, Franklin had an exceptional intelligence. This was evident in the way he approached problems—the man was famous for being economical, community-driven, and supportive of education and hard work. He didn’t come from a wealthy family and was well known for living simply, yet smartly. Partly because of this straightforward, but thorough approach to daily life, he was better able to invent and create or improve solutions to some of the era’s problems.

Take, for example, the trouble of having two different kinds of poor eyesight. Most people have only one vision problem, at most, and during Franklin’s time, eyeglasses to help nearsightedness or farsightedness already existed. Some people, however, experience both kinds of vision deficiencies, whose scientific names are presbyopia (farsightedness) and myopia (nearsightedness). To address both at the same time, Franklin created dual-lens eyeglasses, which offered a bottom half to correct one’s vision of close-by objects and words, and a top half enabling the same viewer to see far away. He did this by cutting the two different necessary lenses in half and combining them. This solution also made it possible to tailor the prescription of each lens to accurately correct the vision of the wearer.

It’s not a perfect system; to this day, even if bifocals have improved, new users can experience headaches or dizziness when first wearing them. However, those in need of bifocals typically acclimate to the two-lens system (and in 1955, an optician named Irving Rips further refined the solution, by creating seamless bifocals from one lens, improving upon the original design). The glasses meet their wearer’s vision needs.

Franklin also addressed common problems. During his lifetime (1706-1790), fireplaces and stoves were the only way to heat one’s home. Burning wood or scrap produces smoke—not always what you want filling your house! To combat the issues of much smoke filling homes and inefficient heating, Franklin created a new system, called the Franklin stove. Essentially, it was an improved fireplace, meant to offer more heat and less smoke than the fireplaces that came before it. To do this, Franklin put something called a baffle (a hollow duct through which cold air entered and hot air exited, warming the room) at the back of his stove. The baffle was open at the bottom and had two holes at the top. Cold air sinks and hot air rises, so the underside of the baffle was meant to take in cold air from the room, heat it with the fire’s flames, and release the heated air back into the room. Franklin’s other adjustment was the attachment of an inverted siphon to the baffle. This inverted siphon was a U-shaped duct that he thought would carry smoke away from the room and up a chimney.

Interestingly, Franklin’s stove wasn’t particularly successful. It addressed two of the main heating problems of the day—inefficiency and an excess of smoke—but it didn’t actually work that well. The inverted siphon only functioned correctly if the fire burned consistently, a factor that couldn’t be guaranteed. However, given the problems and the way people built their homes in 1741, when Franklin invented his stove, the equipment he came up with is viewed as a solution that addressed the problems he was concerned with.

Besides dual-purpose eyeglasses and a less smoky fireplace, Franklin is also credited with inventing the lightning rod. This is perhaps his most famous invention, and with good reason. Before it, lightning striking one’s home could have disastrous consequences, especially since houses were generally made from wood. The invention came about as a way for Franklin to test a hypothesis. He believed that lightning was related to electricity—a common piece of knowledge now, but new in 1750, when he invented the lightning rod.

By understanding that lightning tended to hit the highest, nearest point, Franklin determined that putting a rod on the top of a building meant lightning would be more likely to hit the rod than the house itself. Franklin’s lightning rod connected to a wire that ran down through the house and into the ground, where it was attached to a ground rod. Both rods were made from metal, which Franklin theorized would conduct the electricity of the lightning. By moving from the first rod down the length of the wire, the lightning’s energy could be safely transmitted into the ground, where it would no longer pose a threat to one’s home or body.

Franklin didn’t just deal with objects as solutions to problems. He was the first known creator of a “pros and cons” list, which is an invention to assist with decision-making. In a 1772 letter to a friend, he laid out how he made difficult decisions: he divided a piece of paper into two columns, with one headed “pros” and the other “cons.” He would think about the pros and cons of a particular decision for several days, writing them down whenever they came to him. When no more occurred to him, he would go through each side of the list, assigning a weight to every point. Then he would strike out a pro for every con. At the end, he would see if the balance was on one side or the other, think about the problem for another day, and then make a decision.

This kind of systematic approach to decision-making was probably quite useful for Franklin’s overall approach to making scientific inquiries, which he applied in his research too. For instance, he was very interested in population growth, particularly in the American colonies. In the 1700s, the colonies’ population was exploding, but no one knew by how much. After studying the growth for several decades, beginning in the 1730s, Franklin published “Observations on the Increase of Mankind"" in 1755. This essay explained that rapid population growth usually accompanied an abundance of food supplies. At the time, the Americas had the fastest population growth anywhere in the world and also had a huge amount of farmland, which meant they could easily nurture a growing population. Besides enlightening his readers as to why the colonies were experiencing a surge in citizens, he was also able to explain how much their area was growing. At the time he published “Observations on the Increase of Mankind,” based on his two decades of observation, Franklin theorized that the population of the Americas was set to double every 20 years.

During his lifetime, Franklin was also put in charge of systems affecting the population as a whole. He tended to improve them. In 1775, he was appointed the first Postmaster General of the American colonies. When he began the job, a letter traveling from New York to Philadelphia could take two weeks, even though the distance was only 109 miles. To get a letter safely overseas, a sender would send copies on several different ships, with the hope that at least one of them would make it to the recipient. Post offices were very informal—they could be anything from a town’s inn to its local pub.

As Postmaster General, Franklin instituted several solutions that made sending and receiving mail faster and more reliable. First, he toured all the major post offices and the routes connecting them, so he could learn more about the system as a whole. Based on his observations, he dictated more direct routes between these post offices and had milestones set up on the roads used by mail carriers, so they could more easily follow the correct path. (Roads were very poorly marked in the 1700s.) Second, he specifically improved service between New York and Philadelphia, the colonies’ two biggest, most important cities, by having the mail wagon travel between the cities during the night, as well as the day. Thus more mail was able to travel faster. Lastly, he instituted a standardized chart for mail that made clear what it should cost to mail a letter or package, based on its weight and how far it was traveling.

In an unusual move, Franklin never patented a single one of his designs or inventions, which meant other people were free to copy them, improve upon them, or re-create them. He resisted hoarding his ideas because he truly believed that people benefitted from one another’s inventions. It gave society an advantage if new designs and inventions were available to all, because that way, more minds could work on them in order to make them better. By coming up with devices and systems that addressed certain problems, but refraining from trademarking his inventions, Franklin paved the way for others to continually improve on his initial solutions."
Alexander Graham Bel,"Alexander Graham Bell was in his laboratory, working on a device that would allow people to talk to one another through wires, even when they were not in the same room, or even the same city. Today, we take for granted that we can communicate in real time with people around the corner and around the globe. But in the 1870’s, when Bell was experimenting with his new project, such an idea was like a fantasy.

On March 10, 1876, that fantasy came to life. It is unclear what exactly unfolded that day, but one story says that while working on his voice transmitter, Bell accidentally knocked over a bottle of transmitting fluid, burning his skin. Instinctively, he called out to his assistant, Thomas Watson, to come help: “Mr. Watson. Come here. I want to see you.”

Watson heard those words and was startled. They had come crackling across the earpiece of what the two inventors had labeled the telephone. The experiment was successful. It was the first telephone call.

Alexander Graham Bell’s interest in communications devices traced back to his childhood in Edinburgh, Scotland. He was born on March 3, 1847 to a father who was an expert in speech production and a mother who was a gifted pianist despite being profoundly deaf. The perseverance and success of his mother in the face of such adversity taught young Alexander that problems were surmountable and that he could help people to overcome them.

From a young age, Alexander’s curiosity propelled him to find solutions to problems. When he was 12 years old, he came up with his first invention. While playing in a grain mill with a friend, he was frustrated by the lengthy time it took to remove the husk from the wheat grain. He went home, thought about it, and created a gadget that used rotating paddles and nail brushes to strip the husk off the grain. It was the first of dozens of varied devices that Bell would invent.

Bell’s curiosity and ingenuity were nurtured by his grandfather, a teacher of speech and elocution. When Bell was 15 years old, he went to live with and care for his grandfather, who was aging and ailing. The two grew very close, and the grandfather encouraged Alexander to pursue his inventive streak.

In 1870, the Bell family’s life changed rather abruptly when they moved to Canada. Bell’s two older brothers had died of tuberculosis, and Alexander’s health had been failing, too. His parents were convinced that America would be a healthier environment and moved, first to Ontario, Canada, then to Boston. Bell thrived. His health improved. Eventually, he began to tutor deaf students in Boston.

The parents of two of his students were excited by Bell’s idea to invent a device that transmitted multiple signals over a single wire. One of the parents learned, however, that another inventor, Elisha Gray, was working on a very similar project at the same time. To encourage Bell and to help rush his work along, the parent hired an electrician by the name of Thomas Watson to be Bell’s assistant. He hoped that between Bell’s clever ideas and Watson’s practical skills, the two men would succeed quickly. However, instead of focusing on a multiple-signal transmission device, Bell and Watson focused much of their time on a device to transmit the human voice over wires. To protect their experiment, Bell and Watson’s voice-transmitting device was registered with the United States patent office. Lewis Latimer, another inventor, helped Bell by drafting the drawings of the device for the patent. The patent was well timed: Gray attempted to file for his own “telephone” the very same day, but he was turned away because the idea was already protected and owned by Bell and his supporters.

On that March morning in 1876, Bell’s dream was achieved when the words “Mr. Watson. Come here. I want to see you” traveled from the room Bell was in to the room Watson was in across telephone wires. The two men took their incredible telephone device on the road, demonstrating its proficiency in city after city. The year after his telephone came to life, Bell married Mabel Hubbard, one of the deaf students whose fathers supported Bell’s dream of inventing the telephone.

Bell was challenged dozens of times in lawsuits by people trying to discredit his patent, especially by other inventors who claimed to have invented the telephone before him. He won every time. Bell created the Bell Telephone Company, and in the first 10 years of its existence, telephone ownership in the United States grew to more than 150,000 people. Bell improved the device over the years. For example, he added a microphone that amplified the voice. He also went on to invent and patent many other devices that would have pleased his mother because of the way they helped people to solve problems.

When Bell died on August 2, 1922 in Nova Scotia, Canada, the entire telephone system was shut down for one minute in tribute to the man who revolutionized communications.

Louis Braille,"Have you ever noticed when you step into an elevator that next to the buttons showing the floor numbers, there are small plates with a series of raised dots and bumps? Did you ever wonder what those bumps and dots mean and why they are there? When you run your fingers over those plates, you feel the ridges. When blind people touch them, they read the floor numbers. In a grid of six bumps, with two across and three down, a configuration of two raised bumps across the top and one down on the right side is the number 4; one dot on the top left side and two across the middle is the number 8.

Who invented this elaborate setup of bumps and dots that comprise an entire alphabet and numerical system that allows blind people to read with their fingers? Was it a distinguished scientist, or a brilliant author, or perhaps a famous artist?

Actually, this system, which is called braille, was created by a blind 12-year-old French boy and was named for him. Louis was not always blind. He became blind by accident. Louis Braille was born on January 4, 1809 in a small country village near Paris called Coupvray. His father was a leather worker who made harnesses and other leather goods. One day, when he was just three years old, Louis was in his father’s leather workshop. Like many young children, Louis enjoyed imitating his father. He was fiddling with an awl, a small tool with a round wooden handle and a sharp, pointed metal tip that is used to punch holes in leather. While he was playing, the awl slipped and poked Louis in the eye. A doctor treated the wound as best he could and patched the eye. But the eye became infected, and the infection spread to the other eye. Within a short time, young Louis was totally blind in both eyes.

In those days, many blind people became beggars or performers in sideshows. But Louis’s parents refused to allow their son’s disability to get in the way of his studies or his life. Louis attended school like his brothers and sisters, relying on his creativity, intelligence, and drive to overcome obstacles. To help him navigate the village, his father made him canes. The local priest taught him to use his other senses to learn: his hearing to distinguish the calls of different birds, and his sense of smell to identify different plants and flowers. Louis was one of the brightest students in his school.

In 1819, at age 10, Louis earned a scholarship to attend the Royal Institute for Blind Youth in Paris, the first school in the world devoted to blind children. For Louis, going to the school meant leaving his family and the village he knew well, where he felt safe. But Louis and his family knew the school offered him the best opportunity to get an education and lead a successful life. There he excelled in studying history, math, science, and grammar, but he proved especially gifted at music. Louis became an accomplished pianist and organist. He even got a paid job as an organist, playing in a small church near the institute.

The students at the school learned most of their subjects by listening to lessons. But there were a few books that the school’s founder, a man named Valentin Hauy, had developed by printed raised, or embossed, letters. Reading that way was slow, and the books were large and heavy. But they were the only books available then for blind people. Louis Braille began to wonder: wasn’t there a better way to allow blind people to read?

One day Louis learned about the work of a former French army captain named Charles Barbier. Captain Barbier had invented something called “night writing,” a code of 12 raised dots and dashes that allowed soldiers to communicate with one another at night without using lights that would alert the enemy to their location. The soldiers could “feel” the messages with their fingers, and keep safe. The code turned out to be too complex for the soldiers, but it inspired Louis Braille. Louis simplified the system, reduced the series of dots from twelve to six and eliminated the dashes. By the time he was 20, Louis published his first alphabet for the blind, a system he continued to work on and perfect.

And how did Louis create the dots he used in his revolutionary new system? He used an awl. The very tool that caused his blindness became the instrument that brought the opportunity for reading to Louis and generations of blind people to this day.

The world was slow to accept Louis Braille’s innovation. Indeed, during his lifetime, his method was not widely accepted. Louis Braille died at the young age of 43 from tuberculosis, a devastating respiratory disease. He was buried in his home village of Coupvray.

In time, Braille’s method became accepted around the world. “Braille” alphabets were created in languages spanning the globe. Today, we find them not only on elevator plates, but also on computers and cell phones. And the name Louis Braille stands for innovation, courage, and determination."
The Origins of the Internet,"All of the men were nervous as they waited. But Len Kleinrock was the most nervous. The year was 1969, and just over 20 people were crowded into the room. A group of pale men in their 20s and 30s, the computer scientists stood beside executives from big telephone companies. The men tapped their feet impatiently. They waited.

The computer itself loomed along the wall, 15 feet wide and 35 feet long. A long grey cable snaked from the computer to a smaller machine, the router or “switch,” in the corner. The two machines were important, but the real reason the men had gathered was the activity happening in that long grey cable. They were about to see whether information could successfully flow between a computer and router, for the first time in history.

At the center of the group was Len Kleinrock, the 35-year-old star of computer networking. Kleinrock was a professor at UCLA and was the one who had engineered this system. “Everybody was ready to point the finger if it didn’t work,” said Kleinrock. “Happily, the bits began to flow from the host to router. I like to refer to that day as when the Internet took its first breath of life, first connected to the real world. It’s like when a baby is born and has its first experience of the outside world.”

For Kleinrock, that moment had been almost a decade in the making. He originally became interested in the problem of network connection while working on the East Coast. He recalled, “I looked around at MIT and Lincoln Laboratories [sic]: I was surrounded by computers and recognized that one day they’re going to have to talk to each other. And it was clear that there was no adequate technology to allow that.”

At the same time that Kleinrock was growing absorbed in the problems of network connection, the United States government was ramping up its investment in science and technology research. The Soviet Union’s famous launch of a satellite called Sputnik had been an embarrassment for the United States—the United States thought that it should be the leader of space travel. Eisenhower created a branch within the Department of Defense to ensure that the scientific leadership of America wouldn’t be eclipsed again in the future. This new organization, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), became one of the major engines of technological innovation throughout the 1960s and 1970s.

In 1962, while Kleinrock was finishing up graduate school, ARPA created a new department devoted to computer science. The head of this division was J.C.R. Licklider, a fellow scientist at MIT who also worked on network structures.

“He was one of those visionaries who foresaw the advantages of combining humans with computer,” said Kleinrock of his former colleague and boss. “He created a concept called man-computer symbiosis, recognizing that if you put the two together, you could get very significant results.” Licklider ran into political problems at ARPA and ultimately left to return to MIT, but not until he had planted the idea of networking as a concept worthy of funding.

Bob Taylor took over ARPA’s computer science division in 1966 and reinvigorated the project. Taylor had been funding different projects in computer science departments at universities across the country and realized it was growing too costly to give each department the machines and resources to do every task. What he needed was a way for geographically far-flung research centers to somehow share each other’s computing resources. Taylor needed to create a network. The man he brought in to build it, Larry Roberts, happened to be Kleinrock’s old officemate at MIT.

“We were all intimately familiar with each other’s work, so when they asked, Roberts said, ‘Look, I know exactly what this technology should be, and I know it can work. Len Kleinrock has already proven it,’” recalled Kleinrock. “And bang, the project came to life. After a number of years, it came to action.”

And so it was that all of the men were crowded into the room watching a long grey cable. An air conditioner hummed in the background, fighting against both the heat outside and the heat generated by the massive machine in the room. Cheers broke out when they saw that the information was flowing, but the real test was to come a few weeks later.

The first message between two computers was sent on October 29, 1969. This time the room was empty, except for Kleinrock and one other engineer. They didn’t know that it was such an important milestone, so there was no camera or tape recorder. The two men were trying to log onto a computer at the Stanford Research Institute and successfully got through two letters of the message “login” before the system crashed.

“It was not until this thing called the Internet hit the consumer world that we recognized this network was really important. At that point we looked back and said, ‘What was the first message ever sent on the Internet?’” Kleinrock remembered. “Samuel Morse sent, ‘What hath God wrought?’ Alexander Graham Bell said, ‘Come here Watson I need you.’ Neil Armstrong had his giant leap. These guys were smart and they understood media. We had no such concept, but the message we created, ‘lo,’ [short for ‘login’] that’s the most prophetic, succinct, powerful message we could have come up with by accident.”
